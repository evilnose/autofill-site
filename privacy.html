        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Effective date: August 27, 2018</p>
        <p>College App Autofill ("us", "we", or "our") operates the "College App Autofill" chrome extension.</p>
        <p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our extension and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>
        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve Autofill+ to you.</p>
        <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>
        <h4>Authentication Information</h4>
        <p>When you sign up, we will ask for your email. This is used solely to identify you from other users. We will not use your Authentication Information (i.e. email) for any other purpose.</p>
        <h4>Autofill Information</h4>
        <p>Autofill+ is a service that helps send your information to multiple college applications for you. To do that we need you to provide those information that you want us to send. You can provide and alter these information in the "Form" section of the College App Autofill chrome extension interface. Note that you can provide as little and as much of Autofill Information as you want (or none at all), and you are in full control of the supply and deletion of such information. You can delete the entirety of your information in "My Data" tab in the chrome extension interface.</p>
        <p>Since there is no way for a chrome extension to store local data securely, your Autofill Information is stored in our databases. We process your Autofill Information only while Autofill+ is sending your form to college application websites. We only transfer your Autofill Information between your browser and our databases, and do so only at your request. We will not view or sell your information. Autofill Information may include the following, and any other data that one may provide to a college application website:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First name and last name</li>
            <li>Phone number</li>
            <li>Address, State, Province, ZIP/Postal code, City</li>
            <li>Username and password for college application websites</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that we ask for your college application website username and password (login credentials) for the sake of you convenience; Autofill+ can still operate perfectly without them. Learn about how to skip entering login credentials at (#TODO help url).</p>
        <h2>Use of Data</h2>
        <p>College App Autofill uses the collected data for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To authenticate and identify users</li>
            <li>To fill in college application forms in automated processes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Transfer Of Data</h2>
        <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>If you are located outside United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to United States and process it there.</p>
        <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
        <p>College App Autofill will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.</p>
        <h2>Disclosure Of Data</h2>
        <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
        <p>College App Autofill may disclose your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To comply with a legal obligation</li>
            <li>To protect the personal safety of users of Autofill+ or the public</li>
            <li>To protect against legal liability</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Security of Data</h2>
        <p>The security of your data is important to us but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        <h2>Service Providers</h2>
        <p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our service ("Service Providers"), to provide the service on our behalf, to perform service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our service is used.</p>
        <p>These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
        <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p>
        <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children").</p>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
        <p>We will let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on this website, prior to the change becoming effective and update the "effective date" at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
